# Project Template

This is a simple Template to set up a new Project for a web page
with Javascript.

It is setup so I can use _Coffee-Script_, _Jade_ and _Stylus_.

It's purely meant for personal use. But if anybody else wants to use it,
that's totally fine with me. 

Things I will probably want to add are:

* Testing with _Jasmine_
* adding

```
console.log i*3 for i in [1..10]
```
